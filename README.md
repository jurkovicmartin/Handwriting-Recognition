# Handwriting digit recognition

First take on Keras and Pytorch framework for neural networks.

Both models solve the same problem. Handwriting digit recognition with usage of MNIST dataset.

There are just a simple examples where I tried to create a functional model with both of these frameworks. I wanted to try the workflow and how to start creating a machine learning models.
